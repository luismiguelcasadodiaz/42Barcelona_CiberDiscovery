### I discovered that knowledge kidnaps us and carries us thru the long way, blinding us towards the short path.

After long technical discussions involving nslookup, RFC, protocols, ports, and so on, that took us nowhere, the solution was the web **"instant username"**, a web used to know username availability in different social media platforms.

Another learning to take away was the usage of google lens to locate where, a photo with no GPS metadata, has been shot.

## Directory listing and fuzzing

Directory listing is an Apache configuration Directive that instructs the web server to show folder content when there is no index.htm or index.php file. When such a configuration directive is not properly configured a **fuzzing attack** can be performed. Fuzzing is the art of automatic bug detection. The goal of fuzzing is to stress the application and cause unexpected behavior, resource leaks, or crashes. The process involves throwing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs at a computer. In this case we will test different regular paths after the fully qualified server name.

<a name="traversal"></a>
## Path Traversal

A **path traversal** vulnerability allows an attacker to access files on your web server to which they should not have access. They do this by tricking either the web server or the web application running on it into returning files that exist outside of the web root folder.

You can check a web server footprint with

> curl -I http://ctf.42barcelona.com:3319/

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

I can see that it is an Apache server running on Ubuntu.

Which is the default Apache DocumentRoot folder?

`/var/www/html`

Which is an interesting file for reading while watching soap opera?

`/etc/passwd`

Then, navigating to `http://ctf.42barcelona.com:3319/../../../etc/passwd` would be a potential test for a path traversal attack.....

<a name="injection"></a>  
## SQL injection
SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an answer that the front-end will unknowingly run on the server database an SQL statement that extracts information towards the attacker.

There is a potential danger of using user input directly in SQL statements.

A regular procedure like

```
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
```

makes it possible to the user to transform it into:


|key|User name	|Password	|SQL Query                                                                  |
|---|-----------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|1|tom	|tom	|SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='tom' and password='tom'|
|2|tom	|' or '1'='1	|SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='tom' and password='' or '1'='1'|
|3|tom	|' or 1='1	|SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='tom' and password='' or 1='1'|
|4|tom	|1' or 1=1 -- -	|SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='tom' and password='' or 1=1-- -'|
|5|' or '1'='1	|' or '1'='1	|SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='' or '1'='1' and password='' or '1'='1'|
|6|' or ' 1=1	|' or ' 1=1	|SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='' or ' 1=1' and password='' or ' 1=1'|
|7|1' or 1=1 -- -	|blah	|SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='1' or 1=1 -- -' and password='blah'|

The key point here is to understand that in SQL exists a precedence order in the logical operators. AND has precedence over OR.
That means that in rows 2,3, and 4 above, no matter which is the password, cause the expression to the right of OR always is TRUE.
If 'tom' exists as a user, ` name='tom'` will evaluate to TRUE. TRUE and TRUE becomes TRUE. `SELECT` returns a row with all relevant data from Tom.

In example 6 you will extract all data from user's table. 

`name='' or ' 1=1' and password='' or ' 1=1'` becomes

`name='' or TRUE and password='' or TRUE`, that becomes

TRUE and TRUE.

## Decoding
I had to refresh the difference between charset and encoding.

What is this I found in the first exercise?
NDJCQ057YjQ1M182NF8xNV9jMDBsfQ==

it is made with a charset that contains upper (A-Z) (26 chars), lower(a-z) (26 chars), numbers (0-9) (10 chars),  and '='
 26 + 26 + 10 + 1 = 63, it is close to 64.
 
[Are you ready to understand bit by bit codification Base 64?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)

Gracias a Carlos Mosquera he aprendido a decodificar desde hexadecimal y base64 con la l√≠nea de comandos

`echo '4e 44 4a 43 51 30 35 37 59 6a 51 31 4d 31 38 32 4e 46 38 78 4e 56 39 6a 4d 44 42 73 58 32 4a 31 4e 31 39 6f 4d 33 68 66 4d 54 56 66 59 7a 41 77 62 44 4e 79 66 51 3d 3d' | xxd -r -p | base64 -d`

## Hashing
As the only way to revert a hash is to find a text that generates the same hash I googled for some hint.

When you know someting about the structure of what you are looking for you can accelate the discovery process.

### Exercise one

From the web [Cyber Chef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) is possible to obtain a hash analysys that helps you reduce the search/reversal scope.

```

Hash length: 32
Byte length: 16
Bit length:  128

Based on the length, this hash could have been generated by one of the following hashing functions:
MD5
MD4
MD2
HAVAL-128
RIPEMD-128
Snefru
Tiger-128
```
With this knowledge,  I looked for [A MD5 reversal hash tool](https://www.md5online.org/md5-decrypt.html)

### Exercise two 
For the second exercise, a hash of 40 chars

`c967d488512ab5559b446f97843de1be0d615088`

cyber chef hinted to me with:

```
Hash length: 40
Byte length: 20
Bit length:  160

Based on the length, this hash could have been generated by one of the following hashing functions:
SHA-1
SHA-0
FSB-160
HAS-160
HAVAL-160
RIPEMD-160
Tiger-160
```

#### First approach
OSINT suggested that hashcat would be a good tool.

With this [Hashcat beginners guide](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/hashcat-tutorial-beginners/) I started the job.

To know  hash modes **available** at Hashcat tool `Hashcat -h | grep 160` 
| Mode      | Name                                                      |usage|
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|------|
|   6000 | RIPEMD-160                                                 | Raw Hash|
|    160 | HMAC-SHA1 (key = $salt)                                    | Raw Hash authenticated|
|   1600 | Apache $apr1$ MD5, md5apr1, MD5 (APR)                      | FTP, HTTP, SMTP, LDAP Server|


To know potential hash modes that suit the hash to decypher use:

>hashcat --show target.txt

```
The following 7 hash modes match the structure of your input hash:

      # | Name                                                       | Category
  ======+============================================================+======================================
    100 | SHA1                                                       | Raw Hash
   6000 | RIPEMD-160                                                 | Raw Hash
    170 | sha1(utf16le($pass))                                       | Raw Hash
   4700 | sha1(md5($pass))                                           | Raw Hash salted and/or iterated
  18500 | sha1(md5(md5($pass)))                                      | Raw Hash salted and/or iterated
   4500 | sha1(sha1($pass))                                          | Raw Hash salted and/or iterated
    300 | MySQL4.1/MySQL5                                            | Database Server

```

In the Slack channel, staff suggested us a word list to try with.

Gave me no results on Thursday

Antonio Gull, the next day, taught me that I had to repeat the argument wordlist and change the attack mode from Straight (0) to combination(1)

`hashcat -m 100 -a 1 target.txt wordlist.txt wordlist.txt`

```

The wordlist or mask that you are using is too small.
This means that hashcat cannot use the full parallel power of your device(s).
Unless you supply more work, your cracking speed will drop.

#### Second approach

I tested with **John the ripper**, the alternative subject hinted.

Inside an Ubuntu virtualbox artifact, I compiled,  from the latest source version [following instructions](https://github.com/openwall/john/blob/bleeding-jumbo/doc/INSTALL-UBUNTU) 

my first try produced:

```
./john  --wordlist=wordlist.txt  --format=raw-sha1  crack.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (has-160 [HAS-160 32/64])
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, 'h' for help, almost any other key for status
0g 0:00:00:00 DONE (2023-06-22 20:48) 0g/s 180.0p/s 180.0c/s 180.0C/s liam..up2u
Session completed.
```

I **wrongly concluded** that password was liam and up2u. 
What I saw `liam..up2u` was the first and the last word form the wordlist.

Eduard vendrell alerted me that it was imposible to get an awswer so fast.

He suffered same problem till he modified inside john.conf the default wordlist file.

Apparently `--wordlist=wordlist.txt` does not work correctly form CLI.

I tried again and got a totally different output
```
./john   --format=raw-sha1   crack.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (Raw-SHA1 [SHA1 256/256 AVX2 8x])
Proceeding with single, rules:Single
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, 'h' for help, almost any other key for status
Almost done: Processing the remaining buffered candidate passwords, if any.

Proceeding with incremental:ASCII
Disabling duplicate candidate password suppressor

Use the "--show --format=Raw-SHA1" options to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed.
```

Cracks of hash are kept in a pot you can review with `./john --show crack.txt`

```
?:liamup2u

1 password hash cracked, 0 left

[I hashed it again at] (http://www.sha1-online.com/) and I got the hash the subject proposes.
